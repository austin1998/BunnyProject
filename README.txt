This project creates a bunny out of vectors. I have png files that the code made. 
these files originally appear in the build folder. 
To test the code, use the command arguments 
../resources/bunny.obj bunny2.png 512 512 2
(File location) (name of png) (width) (height) (style)

Style 
0 makes colorful bunny all vertices are given random colors
1 makes red bunny that shows depth 
2 makes red to white bunny
